# Sentiment Emotion Recognition using CNN & Transfer Learning

This project explores **sentiment and emotion recognition** from text data using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning** techniques.  
It was developed as part of the SIT744 coursework.

## 📌 Overview
- Implements **text preprocessing** (tokenization, embeddings).
- Uses **CNN architecture** for sentiment/emotion classification.
- Leverages **transfer learning** with pre-trained embeddings.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, loss curves, and classification metrics.

## 🚀 Features
- Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).
- Emotion recognition (anger, joy, sadness, fear, etc.).
- Model training with CNN and fine-tuned embeddings.
- Visualization of training history and evaluation metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `Sentiment-Emotion-Recognition-using-CNN-Transfer-Learning.ipynb` – Main notebook with full workflow.
- `data/` – Dataset folder (if applicable).
- `models/` – Saved models (if applicable).

## 📊 Results
- Achieved strong performance on sentiment/emotion datasets.
- Visualizations included for loss/accuracy and confusion matrix.
